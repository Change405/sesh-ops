Session is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for secure messaging. Because of its decentralized nature, anyone can 
run a node and participate in the network and get paid for it. This repository contains the infrastructure and 
configuration management for Session Service Nodes on the Arbitrum One network. It uses Terraform for hardware 
provisioning and Ansible for secure, idempotent node configuration.
