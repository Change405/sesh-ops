# Example Terraform Variables File
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed
# Note: terraform.tfvars is gitignored and should never be committed

# IMPORTANT: Hetzner Cloud Token
# DO NOT set hcloud_token in this file for security reasons
# Instead, export it as an environment variable before running Terraform:
#
#   export HCLOUD_TOKEN=$(op read "op://Private/Hetzner/API Key")
#
# This retrieves the token from 1Password CLI, which requires biometric
# authentication and ensures the token is never written to disk

# Future server configuration variables will be added here:
# server_type     = "cx21"
# server_count    = 1
# server_location = "nbg1"
